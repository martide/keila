# Keila Contributor License Agreement

The following is an agreement between an individual copyright owner ("You") - who
submits software code or other copyrightable works (the "Contribution")
to the Keila project - and Philipp Schmieder Medien ("The Keila Maintainers").

**1. You grant The Keila Maintainers the ability to use the Contributions in any way.**
You hereby grant to The Keila Maintainers, a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free,
irrevocable license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your Contribution
and derivative works.

**2. You are able to grant these rights to The Keila Maintainers.**
You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license.

If Your employer has rights to intellectual property that You create,
You represent that You are authorized to make the Contributions on behalf
of that employer, or that Your employer has waived such rights
for the Contributions.

**3. The Contributions are your original work.**
You represent that the Contributions are Your original works of authorship,
and to Your knowledge, no other person claims, or has the right to claim,
any right in any invention or patent related to the Contributions.

You also represent that You are not legally obligated, whether by entering
into an agreement or otherwise, in any way that conflicts with the terms
of this license.
For example, if you have signed an agreement requiring you to assign the
intellectual property rights in the Contributions to an employer or customer,
that would conflict with the terms of this license.

**4. This agreement does not guarantee the acceptance of Your Contribution.**
You understand that the decision to include the Contribution in any project
or source repository is entirely that of The Keila Maintainers, and this agreement does
not guarantee that the Contributions will be included in any product.
